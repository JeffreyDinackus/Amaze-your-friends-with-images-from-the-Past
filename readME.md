# Images from the past




the basic premise of this project is you download the pics who have had their metadata changed to be really old, show them to children or gullible people, claim you took them in the year that is listed(and that you had a phone at the time) -> good times/profit? 

> **Note**
> The images inside will not actually give you gf 


## basic usage 

* download a image you want. 

* open the image on your smartphone and figure out how to see when it was taken on your phone(I reccomend the official photo app on your phone.) 

* show it to people and make stuff up about the image 


Example on my phone
